In the context of our Machine Learning courses we are going to study the “shipping data” dataset. The objective is to predict whether or not a shipment will arrive on time.

This exercise took place on the platform Kaggle, which allows all the participants to submit their prediction and to know their accuracy. The exciting part was the aspect of competition between students, because each time we submitted our predictions, we could see the leader board ruled by the accuracy.
